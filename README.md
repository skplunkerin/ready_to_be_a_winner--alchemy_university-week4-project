# Ready to be a winner?

You'll need to prove your smart contract skills to us. Don't worry, you totally
got this! üí™

## üèÅ Your Goal: Emit the Winner event

Your goal is simple! Emit the winner event on this smart contract on the Goerli
testnet: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xcF469d3BEB3Fc24cEe979eFf83BE33ed50988502#code

If you take a look at the [Code tab in Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xcF469d3BEB3Fc24cEe979eFf83BE33ed50988502#code),
you'll see that the source code for this contract looks like this:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Contract {
    event Winner(address);

    function attempt() external {
        require(msg.sender != tx.origin, "msg.sender is equal to tx.origin");
        emit Winner(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

How do we possibly make it so the `tx.origin` (the EOA who originated the
transaction) is not equal to the `msg.sender`? ü§î

We'll leave that challenge up to you!

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
